# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 
Pewlett-Hackard is preparing for a large number of its employees to retire in the next few years. The company is coloquially referring to this event as the "Silver Tsunami."
In order to help Pewlett-Hackard prepare for this event, this data analysis retrieves key information about the number of potential retirees and which departments will be hit the hardest.
Additionally, this analysis attempts to pull names of potential retirees who may be eligible for a mentorship program that could help smooth the transition to new employees. 

## Results 

### 1. The number of potential retirees is high. 
We filtered Pewlett-Hackard's employee database to focus only on current employees born between 1952 and 1955. After filtering, we found that 72,458 employees may retire soon. 
This means that a large portion of Pewlett-Hackards labor force may need to be replaced in the coming years. 

### 2. Engineers will be in high demand. 
Of the 72,458 potential retirees, 36,291 are engineers. Leadership will need to begin planning for this extremely high demand for new, highly-qualified engineers. 
Additionally, the majority (25,916) of these retiring engineers are at a Senior level. In order to avoid losing a wealth of knowledge, plans for transition should start immediately. 
Senior engineers who are planning to retire should be allotted the time and resources necessary to mentor Engineers and Assistant Engineers who could potentially move up to their positions. 

### 3. Management will stay consistent. 
Only 2 of the 72,458 potential retirees are managers, meaning that management in the majority of departments can stay intact. Emphasis should be placed on the two departments with retiring managers to ensure
that new managers are trained before the retirees leave. 

### 4. Mentorship should be a key focus of all potential retirees in the coming months. 
Engineers, senior staff, and technique leaders should be prepared to begin mentoring younger employees with the goal of promoting these employees after retirement. The production and development departments have ample numbers of potential retirees who could participate in a mentorship program.
However, the number of potential retirees is much lower in finance and human resources. These departments should consider other ways to train and mentor their younger workforce. 

## Summary

### 1. Scope
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
The number of potential-retirees is 72,458. Considering the impact this could have across all departments, Pewlett-Hackard should be prepared to onboard around 75,000 new employees in the next five years.
This could mean that a precautionary increase in Human Resources staff should be put in place before the wave of retirements begin. Additionally, managers in all departments should be making mentorship, training, and
identifying potential promotions in their departments a top priority. 

### 2. Mentorship
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees? Simply put, yes. Each department has over 1000 retirement-ready employees who are eligible to mentor the next generation of employees. 
This query returned the number of retirees in each department. 


Looking at this table, we can see that additional support may be required in Marketing, Finance, Human Resources, Quality Management, Research, and Customer Service. Each of these departments have under 3,000 retirement-ready employees.
However, the Production, Development, and Sales Departments are extremely well-equipped to mentor their next generation of employees. 

### 3. Retiring Managers
There are only two retirement-ready managers at Pewlett-Hackard. They are Hauke Zhang (Sales) and Hilary Kambil (Research). Specific attention should be paid to the transition in these two departments.
